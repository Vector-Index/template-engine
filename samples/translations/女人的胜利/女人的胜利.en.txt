The Victory of Women
One
A woman named Lin Hong, while organizing the drawer of a man named Li Hanlin, discovered an old envelope neatly folded. She opened the envelope and took out another neatly folded envelope. Upon opening it again, she found another folded envelope, and then she saw a key.
This aluminum key was unremarkable; why was it protected by three envelopes? Lin Hong held the key in her hand and noticed it was slightly tarnished, clearly having been used for many years. From the size of the key, she deduced it was not meant for a door lock; it was likely for a drawer lock or a suitcase lock. She stood up and walked to the writing desk, inserting the key into the drawer's lock, but she couldn't open it. She then tried inserting the key into the suitcase's lock, but it wouldn't fit. Next, she searched for all the locks in the house, but the key couldn't open any of them, meaning it had no relation to their family. So...
She realized this key was an unwelcome guest.
That afternoon, the thirty-five-year-old woman was engulfed in doubt, unease, fear, and speculation. Holding the key, she sat on the balcony, sunlight shining on her, remaining motionless for a long time while the sunlight moved across her. She felt lost and bewildered. Later, the phone rang, prompting her to stand up and walk over to answer it. It was her husband calling from a hotel a thousand miles away. He said, "Lin Hong, this is Li Hanlin. I've arrived and settled in. I'm doing well. How about you?"
How about you? She didn't know. She stood there, holding the phone, while the voice on the other end called out, "Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?"
Only then did she respond, "I can hear you."
The voice said, "Then I'll hang up."
The call ended, leaving a long silence, and she put down the phone, returning to the balcony to continue staring at the key. Her husband's call was merely a formality, just to inform her that he still existed.
He indeed existed; his clothes were still hanging on the balcony, his smile framed on the wall, the cigarette he extinguished lay in the ashtray, and several of his friends called, unaware that he was far away. They said on the phone, "What? He's on a business trip?"
She looked at the key in her hand. Now, her husband's entire existence was encapsulated in this key. What did this slightly tarnished key suggest to her? A person she was very familiar with had kept a certain secret from her, just like the three envelopes protecting the key. This secret had been hidden by time, concealed by what she believed to be happy times. Now, she realized this secret was coming to light, and she sensed it might harm her. She heard footsteps approaching up the stairs, getting closer to her, pausing at her door before continuing up.
The next morning, Lin Hong went to Li Hanlin's workplace. She told Li Hanlin's colleague that she needed to take something from the locked drawer. The colleague, recognizing her, pointed to a desk by the window.
She inserted the key into Li Hanlin's desk lock, and it opened. Thus, she found her husband's secret, placed in a large envelope containing two photographs of the same womanâ€”one of her in a swimsuit standing on a beach, and another a black-and-white portrait. This woman appeared younger than her but not more beautiful. There were also five letters, all signed by "Qingqing," a name that stung her eyes. Qingqing, clearly a nickname, was given to her husband by a woman she completely did not know. Her hand trembled as she held the letters. The letters were filled with sweet nothings; this woman and Li Hanlin met often and had phone affairs. Their sweet words were still lavishly spent, evaporating through letters.
In one of the letters, the woman told Li Hanlin to change their contact number to: 4014548.

Lin Hong picked up the phone and dialed the seven digits: 4014548. After a few rings, a woman answered, "Hello."
Lin Hong said, "I want to speak to Qingqing."
The woman on the other end replied, "This is me. Who are you?"
Lin Hong heard her voice was somewhat hoarse, and her hand trembled as she held the phone. She said, "I am Li Hanlin's wife..."
There was a long silence on the other end, but Lin Hong could hear her breathing, irregular and uneven. Lin Hong said, "You are shameless, despicable, vile, you..."
After that, Lin Hong didn't know what else to say; she just felt herself shaking all over. At that moment, the other party spoke, saying, "You should say that to Li Hanlin."
"You are shameless!" Lin Hong shouted into the phone. "You destroyed our family; you are truly shameless..."
"I did not destroy your family," the woman replied. "You can rest assured, I will not destroy your family. Li Hanlin and I will not take it further; we are stopping here. I do not want to marry him; not all women are like you..."
Then, the woman hung up. Lin Hong stood there trembling, tears streaming down her face in anger, the phone's silence buzzing in her ears. After a long time, Lin Hong finally put down the phone, but she still stood there. After a moment, she picked up the phone again and dialed another seven-digit number: 5867346. A man's voice came through, "Hello, hello, who is this? Why is there no sound..."
She said, "I am Lin Hong..."
"Oh, it's Lin Hong..." the man said. "Has Li Hanlin returned?"
"No," she replied.
On the other end, someone said, "Why hasn't he come back yet? It's been many days, right? Oh, wait, not that long, I saw him three days ago. What is he doing this time? Is he trying to sell their water purifier? Actually, their water purifier is completely a scam. He gave me one, and I tested it. I put the water that came out of the purifier in one glass and the water that came directly from the tap in another glass. I couldn't tell which glass had clearer water. I took a sip and couldn't taste which one was cleaner either..."
Lin Hong interrupted him, "Do you know Qingqing?"
"Qingqing?" he replied.
Then there was silence on the other end. Lin Hong held the phone and waited for a moment before the other side said, "I don't know her."
Lin Hong said, trying hard to keep her voice calm, "Li Hanlin is having an affair. He has been seeing another woman behind my back. Her name is Qingqing. I just found out today. They often go on dates, call each other, and even write letters. I got a letter that woman wrote to Li Hanlin. Their relationship has been going on for more than a year..."
At this point, the person on the other end interrupted her, saying, "I know about Li Hanlin, but I don't know this woman named Qingqing. Could it be that you misunderstood them? They might just be ordinary friends... Sorry, someone is knocking at the door. Please hold on..."
The person on the other end put down the phone. After a while, she heard two men talking as they approached the phone. The phone was picked up again, and the other side said, "Hello."
Then there was silence. She knew he was waiting for her to continue, but she didn't want to say anything more. She said, "You have guests, so I won't say anything more."
The other side replied, "Then we'll talk later."
The call was disconnected. Lin Hong continued to hold the phone. She saw another friend's number for Li Hanlin in the phone book, the number was: 8801946. She dialed the number and heard the other side pick up, "Hello."
She said, "This is Lin Hong."
The other side said, "It's Lin Hong! How are you? Where's Li Hanlin? What is he doing?"
After a moment of silence, she said, "Do you know Qingqing?"
There was a long silence on the other end, so she continued, "Li Hanlin is seeing another woman behind my back..."
"No way," the other side finally spoke, saying, "Li Hanlin wouldn't do that. I know him well. You might be overthinking it..."
"I have evidence," Lin Hong said. "I got the letter that woman wrote to him and the pictures she sent him. I just called her..."
The other side said, "I don't know about those things."
The voice on the other end was very cold. Lin Hong knew he didn't want to say anything more, so she hung up the phone and walked to the balcony to sit down. As she sat down, tears began to flow. Li Hanlin had a few friends, but she didn't want to call them anymore. They wouldn't sympathize with her; they would only speak for Li Hanlin because they were his friends. Long ago, she had her own friends, named Zhao Ping, Zhang Lini, and Shen Ning. After marrying Li Hanlin, she had distanced herself from them, taking Li Hanlin's friends as her own. She laughed and chatted with them, went shopping with their wives. After they got married, their wives replaced Zhao Ping, Zhang Lini, and Shen Ning. Now, she realized she had no friends left.
She didn't know anything about Zhao Ping and Zhang Lini. She only had Shen Ning's phone number, which she had been given over a year ago. They occasionally ran into each other on the street, and Shen Ning had given her the number. She wrote it down but then forgot it. Now she remembered and was about to use the number for the first time.
The phone was answered by Shen Ning's husband, who asked Lin Hong to wait a moment. Then Shen Ning picked up the phone and said, "Hello, who is this?"
Lin Hong replied, "It's me, Lin Hong."
The other side let out a cheerful exclamation, and Shen Ning began to talk excitedly, "I'm so happy to hear your voice! I called you, but no one answered. How are you? How long has it been since we last met? More than a year? It feels like it's been many years. Do you have any news about Zhao Ping and Zhang Lini? I haven't seen them in years. How are you?"
"I'm not well," Lin Hong said.
Shen Ning fell silent for a moment before asking, "What did you just say?"
At this point, tears streamed down Lin Hong's face as she told Shen Ning, "My husband has betrayed me. He is seeing another woman..."
Lin Hong choked up and couldn't continue. Shen Ning asked her on the phone, "What happened?"
"Yesterday," Lin Hong said, "I was organizing his drawer and found a folded envelope. When I opened it, there were two more envelopes inside. He had wrapped a key in three envelopes, and I became suspicious. I tried to open all the locks in the house, but none worked. I thought it might be the key to his desk drawer. This morning, I went to his office and found the letter from that woman and two pictures..."
"Despicable!" Shen Ning cursed on the phone.
Lin Hong felt she finally had support. She could release all the grievances, sadness, and anger inside her. She said, "I gave him everything. I never thought about what I should do for myself. I was always thinking about him, what to cook for him, what clothes he should wear. After marrying him, I forgot about myself; I only thought of him. But he did such a thing outside..."
As Lin Hong spoke, her cries replaced her words. At this moment, Shen Ning asked her, "What do you plan to do?"
Lin Hong sobbed, "I don't know."
"I'll tell you," Shen Ning said, "at this moment, you can't be weak or kind. You have to punish him. From now on, don't cry anymore, especially not in front of him. You need to have a stern face, ignore him, don't cook for him, don't do his laundry, don't do anything for him. Don't let him sleep in the bed anymore; make him sleep on the sofa. At least let him sleep on the sofa for a year. He will beg you, he might even kneel down, he will slap himself, and you mustn't feel soft-hearted. He will swear again and again; men love to swear, and their oaths are no different from a dog's bark. Don't believe him. In short, you need to make him understand the cost of his infidelity, make him live in deep water and scorching fire every day, make him feel like he doesn't want to live anymore, feel that life is worse than death..."
Three
A few days later, Li Hanlin returned home. He saw Lin Hong sitting on the balcony, indifferent to his return. He placed his bag on the sofa, walked in front of Lin Hong, and looked at her for a while. He saw Lin Hong like a wooden chicken, and he asked, "What happened?"
Lin Hong's eyes were fixed on the carpet. Li Hanlin waited beside her for a while, but she remained silent. He then walked back to the sofa, opened his bag, took out the dirty clothes, and threw them on the sofa. He turned to look at Lin Hong, who still had her head down. He felt a bit displeased and said, "What are you doing?"
Lin Hong's body moved slightly, her face turned towards the outside of the balcony. Li Hanlin continued to sort through his bag, taking everything out and placing it on the sofa. Then he got angry and walked towards Lin Hong, shouting, "What the hell are you doing? I just got home, and you have a long face. What did I do to offend you?"
Li Hanlin suddenly lost his voice when he saw Lin Hong holding a set of keys. A buzzing sound filled his head like bees. He stood there for a moment, then walked to his room, opened the drawer, and found a stack of magazines. His hand felt around under the magazines, but when he reached the right corner, he couldn't find the neatly stacked envelope.
He felt his breathing become difficult.
Li Hanlin stood by the window for almost half an hour, then walked out of the room, quietly approached Lin Hong, lowered his head, and bent his body down, saying to her, "Have you been to my office?"
Lin Hong sat there motionless. After looking at her for a while, Li Hanlin said again, "Did you see the letter that Qingqing wrote to me?"
Lin Hong's shoulders began to tremble. Li Hanlin hesitated for a moment and placed his left hand on Lin Hong's shoulder. Lin Hong suddenly moved her body, shaking off his hand with her shoulder. His hand returned to its original place, hanging down.
Li Hanlin put that hand into his pants pocket and said, "It's like this: I met Qingqing two years ago at a friend's house. Qingqing is that friend's cousin. I often saw her at my friend's house. Then one day, I ran into her on the street, and after that, we started meeting frequently. She lives with her parents, and I live with you, so we didn't have the conditions. I mean, we didn't have the conditions to have a physical relationship. The places we met were all in cinemas, parks, and just walking on the street. We only... only kissed..."
He saw Lin Hong shed tears, and his hand, which was in his pants pocket, reached out towards Lin Hong's shoulder. But he saw Lin Hong's shoulder tense up, so he had to withdraw his hand. He touched his forehead and continued, "That's all there is to my relationship with her. Even if you hadn't found out, we wouldn't have gone further. I cherish this family in my heart; I won't destroy the home that you and I have built..."
Lin Hong suddenly stood up and walked into the bedroom, then slammed the door shut. Li Hanlin stood still for a moment, and after about five minutes, he walked to the bedroom door, gently knocked twice, and then said, "From today on, I won't see Qingqing again."
Four
Lin Hong thought: He didn't plead with me, didn't kneel, didn't slap himself, didn't make any solemn promises, not even an apology.
But he slept on the sofa; Shen Ning was right about that. Before he slept on the sofa, he stood in front of her bed for a long time, like a calculating businessman weighing the pros and cons, and in the end, he chose the sofa.
Choosing the sofa meant choosing silence, choosing a life apart from her. He separated his life from hers, no longer discussing Qingqing with her, and of course, he no longer acted as a husband. He moved cautiously in the house, trying not to make any noise, avoiding turning on the TV. He confined his space to the sofa, either sitting or lying down, and he started readingâ€”this person who had never read before was now engrossed in books.
When she appeared in front of him, he would immediately put down the book, looking at her. On one hand, he was observing her expression; on the other hand, he was expressing himself. He was not immersed in the joy of reading; he was still anxious in reality.
His silence made her angry; he created a home with no sound. Did he think he could get away with it?
The problem was she couldn't tolerate it; she couldn't let him have a peaceful life. He betrayed her, and now he thought he could just be careful?
She began to provoke him. She saw him sitting on the sofa with his feet on the ground, and she walked towards the balcony. When she reached his feet, she kicked them hard, as if his feet were blocking her way. She walked onto the balcony, waiting for his reaction, but he showed no response; not even pain could make him speak. She stood there for a while, then turned and walked back to her bedroom. This time, she saw his feet curled up on the sofa.
She continued to provoke him. When evening came, she walked to the sofa, threw his blanket, his clothes, and his books all onto the floor, and then sat down on the sofa, turning on the TV to watch.
While all this was happening, he was sitting on the sofa. After the TV was on, he stood up and walked to the balcony, sitting on the hard floor there to continue reading his book. He did this to show her his humility; he believed he was unworthy to sit with her or watch TV together. He remained sitting on the hard balcony floor, getting up a few times to stretch, and after moving around, he would sit back down to read. It wasn't until she got up and left, returning to the bedroom to lie down, that he returned to the sofa, picked up the things she had thrown on the floor, and then lay down on the sofa to sleep.
His silence was boundless, making her unsure of what to do. All her provocations seemed to sink like stones into the sea, receiving no response. Eventually, she gave up her own bed, lying down on the sofa to watch TV, and fell asleep there, sleeping soundly until dawn. Although this contained her scheme, it also seemed natural.
She occupied the place where he slept while giving up her own bed, letting that soft bed tempt him into carelessly falling asleep, thus gaining the opportunity to struggle with him. However, when dawn broke and she woke up on the sofa, she saw him sitting in a chair, his head resting on the dining table as he slept.
He seemed to be living with his tail between his legs at home, as if he was already punishing himself. The problem was that this punishment affected her; she had tears she couldn't shed, words she couldn't shout. She was filled with anger, but it could only burn within her. She no longer expected him to plead or kneel; everything her friend Shen Ning had said, she no longer expected to happen. What she craved now was a big fight, even a fistfight would be better than this.
But he refused to give her that opportunity, meaning he rejected the punishment she had chosen. He judged himself and meticulously obeyed that judgment, ultimately making her feel that he had become accustomed to this miserable life. He seemed to have found peace with it; every morning, he always left the house before her and returned home after her in the evening. This was unassailable; his workplace was much farther than hers, and it had always been this wayâ€”he was always out early and back late. She didn't know where he had lunch at work or where he had dinner; she no longer prepared dinner for him. When he returned, he didn't even step into the kitchen or glance at it, and she knew he was already full. He sat on the sofa, picking up a book. The books in his hands changed one after another, and she knew he had read them all. He disrupted her life, causing her mental state to become unbalanced, yet he adjusted everything about himself very well. Thus, she was filled with rage, gritting her teeth, but she didn't know how to vent it.
That evening, she stood on the balcony and suddenly saw him walking out of a restaurant downstairs. She began to realize where he had had dinner. She trembled with anger; while she was counting the days like years, he was going in and out of restaurants, living an unrealistic luxurious life. She immediately went downstairs; although she had already had dinner, she wanted to eat another meal. She brushed past him on the stairs without looking at him and quickly walked into the restaurant he had just exited. She ordered several dishes and some wine, but after taking a couple of bites, she couldn't eat anymore.
After eating three meals in the restaurant, she felt pained about the money. She had used their savings from the bank; they didn't have much money, and there were still many essential things they hadn't bought. This thought made her stop in her tracks; her feet couldn't cross the threshold of the restaurant. She stood back in front of the stove in her kitchen, making herself the simplest dinner.
However, when she continued to see him coming out of the restaurant below from her balcony, her anger drove her back into that restaurant until one time, she encountered him there. When she walked in that time, she saw him eating a bowl of noodles. She sat down at a table far from him, watching the people around him eating lavishly while he was eating a bowl of noodles in a shabby manner, and suddenly felt a pang in her heart.
Thus, later on, when she prepared dinner for herself, she also made a portion for him. She placed an empty bowl in the most conspicuous spot on the table, put a pair of chopsticks on the bowl, and set the food aside. She hoped he would notice these as soon as he came in. He didn't disappoint her in this regard; when he saw the dinner prepared for him, his eyes lit up, and then he cautiously looked at her to confirm it was for him. Even though he had already eaten noodles, he still sat down at the table and finished all the dinner she had made.
By the time he finished eating, she had already returned to the bedroom and closed the bedroom door. She lay on the bed, listening to him open the door and walk to the bed. He stood there for a moment before sitting down on the edge of the bed and said to her, "Can we talk?"
She didn't respond. After a while, he continued, "Can we talk?"
She still didn't say anything, but she hoped he would speak at length. She thought he should blame himself; even if he wasn't crying, he should be pounding his chest in regret. He should kneel down as Shen Ning had said, should swear an oath, and should say everything that needed to be said. Although she wouldn't pay him any attention, he had to do this. However, all he could say was, "Can we talk?"
He sat in front of her bed for a long time. Seeing that she remained silent, he stood up and walked out. She heard him gently close the door, and her tears immediately flowed out. He just walked away irresponsibly like that. He returned to the sofa, and after lying down, the progress that had just appeared vanished, and everything returned to the way it was at the beginning.
For twenty-six days, Li Hanlin could no longer endure it. He told Lin Hong that all the joints in his body were aching, he could not turn his neck freely, and his stomach was also hurting intermittently due to the irregularity of life. So he said, "This kind of life should come to an end."
At that moment, his voice became loud; he was no longer cautious or tiptoeing. He stood in front of Lin Hong, waving his arms, appearing justified. He said, "I have already punished myself, but you still refuse to forgive me. If we continue like this, not only I, but you too will be unable to bear it. I have truly had enough of this life; I cannot go on like this. We can only..."
He paused for a moment: "We can only get a divorce."
While he was speaking, Lin Hong had her back to him. When she heard him say the last sentence, she suddenly turned her face around and said, "Don't even think about divorcing me! You have hurt me, and you haven't paid the price yet. You just want to run away, to go to Qingqing. I will not agree to that. I want to hold you back; I want to drag you to old age, to death..."
She saw a smile appear on Li Hanlin's face, and she suddenly realized that he actually did not oppose being held back, even if it meant dragging him to gray hair and death; he would not raise any objections. So she stopped speaking. She stood there, unsure of what to do, feeling tears streaming down her face. As the tears flowed, she felt humiliation. After so many days of suffering, all she got in return was his smile. She had been waiting for his confession, his self-reproach; at the very least, he should have shed tears of true remorse, but he did nothing, instead standing in front of her, justifyingly saying, "We can only get a divorce."
She raised her hand to wipe her tears and then said, "Forget it, let's just get a divorce."
After saying this, she saw the smile on his face vanish in an instant. She turned and walked into the bedroom, locked the door, and then lay down on the bed fully clothed and fell asleep.
Six
They walked on the street, heading to the street office where their marriage was established. Now, they were going there for the second time to annul their marriage. They walked along the wall by the street, with Li Hanlin in front and Lin Hong behind. After walking for a while, Li Hanlin would stop and wait for Lin Hong to catch up before continuing. Neither of them spoke; Li Hanlin kept his head down, frowning, looking heavy-hearted. Lin Hong, on the other hand, tilted her face up, letting the autumn wind blow her hair. Sometimes a faint smile appeared on her expressionless face, her smile as desolate as falling leaves.
They passed many familiar shops, each of which they had entered together several times. They also walked past many bus stops where they had once stood together waiting... Thus, they walked down the road of memories, and time seemed to flow backward. They arrived at a cafÃ© called Dusk, where Li Hanlin stopped. After Lin Hong caught up, he did not continue walking because he remembered that a few years ago, after they registered their marriage at that street office, they had come here, sitting by the street-facing window. He had a cup of coffee, and she had a Sprite. So he called out to her, saying, "Shall we go in for a drink?"
At that moment, Lin Hong had already walked past. She turned around, looked up, and saw the neon sign built under the eaves, which spelled out "Dusk CafÃ©." So she accepted his suggestion, and they walked into the cafÃ© together. It was afternoon, and there were not many people in the cafÃ©. They chose to sit by the street-facing window; he ordered a cup of coffee, and she ordered a Sprite. Then they both began to reminisce about what they had each drunk here a few years ago to celebrate their marriage.
Li Hanlin smiled first, and Lin Hong smiled too, but they quickly put away their smiles and turned their faces away. Li Hanlin looked out the window, while Lin Hong looked at the other people in the cafÃ©. She noticed a young woman dressed in bright red, sitting alone to their right, watching them. Lin Hong felt a strange expression on her face, and then she recognized who she was. A name flashed in Lin Hong's mind: Qingqing.
Lin Hong immediately looked at Li Hanlin, who also saw Qingqing. Clearly, he had not expected to encounter her here, so his face was filled with surprise. When he turned his face back and saw Lin Hong looking at him, he knew from her gaze that she had understood. He gave Lin Hong a wry smile.
Lin Hong said, "You informed her."
Li Hanlin replied, "What are you talking about?"
Lin Hong said, "You told her we were getting a divorce, so she came."
Li Hanlin said, "No!"
Sadness surged in Lin Hong's heart. She said, "Actually, you don't need to be so anxious..."
"No," Li Hanlin said again, "She knows nothing."
Lin Hong stared hard at Li Hanlin. She saw a very determined look on his face, and she began to believe his words a little. She looked again at the young woman, who was still watching them. When Lin Hong saw her, the woman immediately averted her gaze. Lin Hong said to Li Hanlin, "She has been looking at you; you should go over and say a few words to her."
"No," Li Hanlin said.
Lin Hong continued, "We are about to get a divorce; what are you afraid of?"
"No," Li Hanlin said again.
Lin Hong looked at Li Hanlin, and his unwavering attitude suddenly warmed her. She turned to look at Qingqing again, but this time Qingqing was not looking at them; she was lifting her cup to drink, one leg crossed over the other, her movements lacking the usual ease. Lin Hong looked back at Li Hanlin, who was gazing out at the street with a furrowed brow and a serious expression. After watching him for a while, Lin Hong said, "Kiss me."
Li Hanlin turned his face, surprised to look at Lin Hong. She continued, "Kiss me, you won't kiss me again in the future, so I want you to kiss me now."
Li Hanlin nodded and leaned closer. Lin Hong said, "I want you to sit next to me and kiss me."
So Li Hanlin immediately got up and sat beside Lin Hong. He pressed his lips against her cheek, and at that moment, Lin Hong said, "Hold me."
Li Hanlin embraced her, and then he felt her lips brush against his face, capturing his mouth, her tongue slipping into his, her hands holding him. At that moment, Li Hanlin experienced a kiss that felt as long as the night; she controlled his body with her hands and his mouth with her tongue, her warmth entering him through his mouth and then spreading endlessly within him.
Lin Hong's eyes remained on the woman named Qingqing, watching her glance over at them from time to time, anxiously moving the cup on the table, and finally seeing her stand up and hurriedly leave the cafÃ© called Dusk. When her red figure flashed past them and would not return, a wave of joy surged within Lin Hong, and she suddenly felt victorious. After twenty-six days of sadness and anger, insomnia and emptiness, she had won without a fight.
She released her hand from Li Hanlin and moved her mouth away from his, then smiled at him and said, "Let's go home."
